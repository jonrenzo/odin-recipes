    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Pinoy recipe is a popular Filipino main dish usually served with rice and veggie sides.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and sliced</li>
        <li>3 cloves fresh garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon whole peppercorns</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon fine salt, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <ul>Whisk soy sauce, jalapeno peppers, and garlic together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add chicken wings and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.</ul>
        <ul>Remove chicken wings from the marinade and shake off excess. Reserve marinade.</ul>
        <ul>Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Place chicken wings in the hot oil and pan-fry for 2 minutes per side. Slowly pour in reserved marinade (including garlic) and water. Bring to a boil. Add bay leaves and peppercorns and simmer until chicken is tender, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</ul>
        <ul>Stir in vinegar and cook for 5 minutes. Stir again and season with sugar and salt to taste. Serve hot.</ul>
    </ol>
